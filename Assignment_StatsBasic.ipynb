        "1. Mean:\n",

        "\n",
        "The normal distribution (also known as the Gaussian distribution) is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. It is a continuous probability distribution characterized by a symmetric, bell-shaped curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Properties of the Normal Distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetry:\n",
        "\n",
        "The normal distribution is symmetric about the mean (𝜇), meaning that the left and right sides of the curve are mirror images of each other.\n",
        "This implies that the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
        "Bell-Shaped Curve:\n",
        "\n",
        "The curve of the distribution is bell-shaped, with the highest point at the mean. As you move away from the mean, the frequency of values decreases.\n",
        "Mean and Standard Deviation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean (μ) determines the center of the distribution.\n",
        "The standard deviation (σ) controls the spread or width of the distribution. A larger standard deviation results in a wider and flatter curve, while a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller curve.\n",
        "Total Area Under the Curve:\n",
        "\n",
        "The total area under the curve of a normal distribution is equal to 1, representing the total probability (100%).\n",
        "Explanation of the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule):\n",
        "\n",
        "Within 1 standard deviation (68%):\n",
        "\n",
        "Approximately 68% of data points in a normal distribution will fall within one standard deviation above or below the mean.\n",
        "Within 2 standard deviations (95%):\n",
        "\n",
        "Around 95% of data points will lie within two standard deviations from the mean.\n",
        "Within 3 standard deviations (99.7%):\n",
        "\n",
        "Nearly all (99.7%) data points will be situated within three standard deviations of the mean.\n",
        "Important considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Not all data is normally distributed:\n",
        "\n",
        "The empirical rule only applies to data that follows a normal distribution.\n",
        "Outliers:\n",
        "\n",
        "If data significantly deviates from the normal distribution, points falling outside the 3 standard deviation range could be considered outliers\n"
